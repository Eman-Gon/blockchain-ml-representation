# Ethereum Wallet Transaction Analysis
**Prepared by:** Emanuel Gonzalez

## Purpose
This project shows how blockchain data can be accessed, analyzed, and visualized using Dune Analytics and Python. 

## Project Overview
The project analyzes one Ethereum wallet and explores key metrics:
- **ETH Sent Over Time**
- **Gas Fees Over Time**
- **Daily ETH Sent**
- **Top 5 Recipient Addresses**

## Why This Matters
Understanding on-chain data reveals patterns in usage, spending, automation, or unusual behavior. Itâ€™s relevant for developers, researchers, investors, and regulators.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Dune Analytics
- Pandas, Matplotlib

## Why a Team Is Needed
Large-scale blockchain analysis involves:
- Managing big data pipelines
- Clustering wallet behaviors
- Creating dashboards
- Machine learning for anomaly detection

This project lays the foundation for club-based collaboration at Cal Poly Blockchain Club.
